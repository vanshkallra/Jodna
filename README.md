JODNA is a lightweight, designer-focused ticket and review system built as an **Adobe Express add-on**.  
Inspired by the Hindi/Urdu word "जोड़ना" (jodna) meaning *to join* or *to connect*, JODNA seamlessly connects design teams, feedback loops, visual assets, and iterative workflows — without the complexity of full-scale tools like Jira.

### Why JODNA?

Most ticket tools are built for engineers — JODNA is built for **designers**.  
It removes friction from feedback cycles, asset sharing, and revisions while staying minimal and integrated where designers already work.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🏢 Organization & Role Management
- **Admin-led Organizations**  
  Admins can create and manage organizations that act as isolated workspaces for design teams.
- **Invite-Only Access**  
  Users can join an organization using a **unique invite code** generated by the system.
- **Role-based Workflow**  
  Admins oversee projects, tickets, and reviews, while designers focus on execution.

---

### 📁 Project & Ticket Management
- **Project-based Structure**  
  Organizations contain multiple projects to keep design work structured.
- **Lightweight Ticket System**  
  Tickets represent individual design tasks and are assigned by admins to designers.
- **Design References**  
  Admins can attach images and assets as references during ticket creation.

---

### 🔄 Review & Iteration Workflow
- **Admin Review Process**  
  Completed tickets are submitted for admin review.
- **Visual Feedback**  
  Admins can add comments and upload images as feedback during review.
- **Reassign for Revisions**  
  Tickets can be reassigned to designers if reiteration is required.

---

### 📝 To-Do Management (Manual + AI)
- **Manual To-Dos**  
  Admins can create task-level to-dos for tickets.
- **AI-Generated To-Dos**  
  To-dos can be generated automatically using an LLM (Gemini API) via API calls, helping break down design tasks efficiently.

---

### 🖼️ Organization Asset Library
- **Shared Assets**  
  Each organization has a private asset library for sharing images and design resources.
- **Access Controlled**  
  Assets are visible only to members of the same organization.

---

### 🔐 Authentication & Security
- **Multiple Login Methods**  
  Supports email/password authentication and Google OAuth 2.0.
- **JWT-Based Authorization**  
  Secure API access using JSON Web Tokens.
- **Session Support**  
  Express sessions enabled for flexible authentication handling.

---

### 🎨 Adobe Express Native Experience

  Built as a lightweight add-on integrated directly into Adobe Express.
- **Adobe Spectrum UI**  
  Uses Adobe Spectrum Web Components for a native look and feel.
- **Seamless Designer Workflow**  
  Designers can manage tickets, view references, and respond to feedback without leaving Adobe Express.

---

### ⚙️ Modern & Scalable Architecture

  React (Frontend), Express.js (Backend), and MongoDB (Database).
- **RESTful APIs**  
  Clean and extensible API design for tickets, projects, assets, and AI services.

## 📦 Installation


1.Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/JODNA.git
cd JODNA
```

2.Frontend (Adobe Express Add-on)
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
npm run start      # usually starts dev server at https://localhost:5241
```
3.Backend
```bash
cd ../backend          # or open new terminal
npm install
npm run start          # starts Express server (default PORT=5000)
```
4. Create a .env file in /backend 

Sample env
```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/jodna    # or your Atlas URI
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
SESSION_SECRET=super-long-random-secret-string
NODE_ENV=development
FRONTEND_URL=https://localhost:5241           # must match your frontend dev server
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-google-gemini-api-key     # if using Gemini for LLM todos
```

6. Enable Developer Mode & Sideload the Add-on in Adobe Express
Open Adobe Express in your browser (Chrome recommended).
Go to the Add-ons panel (left sidebar → puzzle icon).
Enable Developer Mode (toggle in top-right of Add-ons panel — only needed once).
Click Test your local add-on (or similar — may say "Connect local add-on").
Enter your local URL: https://localhost:5241 (accept any local network permission prompt in Chrome 142+).
If successful, JODNA should appear in your add-ons list → click to load it.
Refresh/reload if manifest or code changes don't appear immediately.
